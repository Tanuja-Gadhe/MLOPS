MLOPS

Machine Learning Lifecycle
data      -> Data          -> feature     -> Model           -> Deployment
collect      preprocessing    Engineering    Building/Testing

-Tools
  DVC - Data Version Control, MLflow- monitoring ,     

Devops vs mlops
- MLOPS -> model decaying -> change happens over time , no change in pipeline -> change in data over time 
- model drifting -> sudden change in data ,
  due to change in data (train on different data) - some changes in the feature , -> select new features


after the model decays or drifts -> again goes in cycle -> select new features

Devops -> only some features are added

-Steps
1 Ml Model
